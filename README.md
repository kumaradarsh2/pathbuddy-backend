# PathBuddy Backend

A Node.js backend API for connecting students with mentors through a centralized matching platform. Originally developed for a hackathon and now being expanded as a full-stack learning project.

## Overview

PathBuddy provides a RESTful API to match students with mentors based on their specific needs and manage support requests between them. The platform aims to streamline the mentorship process by offering intelligent matching algorithms and comprehensive request management.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** (ES Modules)
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **MongoDB** - Database
- **Mongoose** - ODM for MongoDB
- **Postman** - API testing

## Current Features

- Express server setup with ES Modules support
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose ODM
- Story model with POST `/stories` endpoint
- Mentor data seeding functionality
- Intelligent mentor matching via GET `/mentors/match` with filtering capabilities

## Project Status

**Backend Development: ~66% Complete**

âœ… **Completed**
- Basic Express application setup
- Database connection and models
- Story management endpoints
- Mentor data seeding
- Mentor matching algorithm

ðŸ”„ **In Progress**
- Request creation endpoint (`POST /request`)
- Request management endpoints (`GET /requests`)
- Code refactoring and folder structure optimization

ðŸ“‹ **Planned**
- Frontend development with React
- Enhanced matching algorithms
- User authentication system
- Admin dashboard
